Hello random person,

If you are reading this, then it's either one of two things, first, you find me extremely attractive or you are a potential client/employer and
I might have just blown my chance at getting hired...

...

...

Anyway, these are all the challenges I did on FrontendMentor... All of which, I did my best to replicate the site or the component that they had.
Each and every single one of these challenges are coded by myself entirely and had no help whatsoever except for the occassional peek at MDN.

That's about it, I hope you have a wonderful day and pray good fortune to your endeavors. Also, please hire me~ :D
