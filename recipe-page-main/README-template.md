## Overview

it's a basic recipe page for an omelette. The goal is to make a responsive layout for this one.

### Screenshot

I don't think that's necessary for this one since its a basic problem and could easily be resolved by using grids.

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

I first started with laying out a grid box as a container. From there, I used display:grid's explicit function to dictate how much the height of the container would be with the addition of a few margins and paddings per row. Then, the width was pretty much trial and error. I first used "vw" but it tend to get ruined when it came to reponsive, so, I settled for a dictated width and made the width responsive using the VW. The table was the most difficult one since I rarely use tables. It took me a while to get the table right and after a lot of reading from mdn I got it pretty close to the original.

The date is 4/1/2024... I managed to finish this project in a little over an hour or so...

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
<!-- - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles -->

### What I learned

The table part was fun, it took me a bit of reading to get the table right and even then, I don't think it's what the original was, but, I am pretty proud of it.

### Continued development

I'm mastering using grid and flexbox. From there, I'm using Grid as the container using the grid-template-row as base. I begin my setup by designating colors and other factors.

### Useful resources

- [Table resource resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) - This helped me for to better understand how the table function works. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

## Acknowledgments

If I could add something.. I would pretty much something like an animation to the omelette picture itself like a gallery of sorts. But, it was a good little exercise before studying JavaScript.
